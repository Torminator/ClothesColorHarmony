The goal of the project is to generate a wardrobe of clothes. Then we combine them to a outfit.
After we have create a outfit, we want to check if the outfit is color harmonious. We use rules 
which we can be found on blog sites and guides for color combination to decide if a outfit is 
color harmonious. Therefore we just use the colors of the clothes and create a color palette for 
the outfit and decide if the color palette meets the criterias of being color harmonious.
